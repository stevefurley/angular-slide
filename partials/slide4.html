    <h2>What about ‘wearing’ them in?</h2>
    <p>
      Interestingly I never had an issue bedding them in which is a first. Most boots I have had to spend some time wearing them around the house and then a few times practicing, but not with these ones. It’s weird how they felt like they had already been bedded in, the boot is really comfortable to wear and surprisingly not heavy.</p>
